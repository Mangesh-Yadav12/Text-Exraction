# Text-Exraction

In this project, we will be working on extracting text from images. After extracting the text we will apply some basic functions of OpenCV to that text to enhance it and to get more accurate results. This project will be instrumental as it will save time and effort of typing from an image

Conclusion:
We started with learning how to install Tesseract which is used for text extraction. Next, we took an image and extracted the text from that image. We learned that we need to use certain image transformation functions of OpenCV to extract text from complex images.

Scope:
Different organizations can use this to extract useful information from the image and store it. Individuals can use it to save their time and effort in typing.
